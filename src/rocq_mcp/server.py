explore candidate tactics (read-only) -> rocq_check to commit the winner \

rocq_compile_file + rocq_verify (and rocq_assumptions for an axiom audit) \
to finish. Never iterate by re-running coqc on a scratch file: coqc \
reloads every import per call; the interactive session does not.

State rules: rocq_check and rocq_step_multi require an explicit \

live in a process-global LRU table; states you keep using stay alive. If \
a state_id goes missing, restart the session with rocq_start.

Failures: every failure response is {success: false, error, reason}. \
Dispatch on reason, not on message text; reason is one of: validation, \
not_found, timeout, crashed, memory_exhausted, lock_contended, \
unavailable, tactic_failed, compile_error, axiom_dependency, \
type_mismatch. When a response carries pet_restarted: true, call \
rocq_diag to see what happened.

    1. PetanqueError import check

    3. _ensure_pet (lazy-init the pet subprocess)
    4. asyncio.Semaphore + asyncio.wait_for (async-level timeout)
    5. All standard exception handlers

    *fn* receives the live pet client and must return the desired result.
    It runs inside a background thread with _pet_lock held; the lock is
    released automatically when *fn* returns or raises.

    *tool* is the canonical MCP tool name (e.g. ``"rocq_check"``) and is
    used both as the prefix in user-facing error messages
    (``"rocq_check timed out after 30s."``) and as the ``tool`` field on
    ``recent_errors`` entries.  Pass exactly the public tool name, not a
    human phrase.

    When pet crashes (timeout, broken pipe), the return dict includes
    ``"pet_restarted": True`` so callers can decide whether to retry.

    If *partial_state* is given (a mutable dict), *fn* can populate it
    with intermediate results.  On timeout or error the dict contents
    are merged into the error response so partial work is not lost.

    When *auto_record* is False (default True), failure paths still
    return the same failure-envelope dict but skip the ``_record_error``
    push into ``recent_errors``.  Callers that need to classify the
    failure at their own layer (e.g. ``run_assumptions`` distinguishing
    ``not_found`` from a generic ``rocq_query/crashed``) pass
    ``auto_record=False`` to avoid the double-record / compensating-pop
    dance.

    The return type is left as ``Any`` because the dict shape varies by
    failure mode (success path, ``pet_restarted``-tagged crashes,
    ``partial_state`` merges, etc.) and a TypedDict would be unwieldy.
    The ``"reason"`` key, when present on a failure, is a

    - ``rocq_check`` runs a candidate proof body against a held state.
    - ``rocq_step_multi`` tries several tactics at once against a held

    Use ``rocq_compile_file`` for whole-file verification, axiom audits,
    and final compile — coqc reloads all imports per call (often several
    seconds on heavy library imports).  Preferred over ``rocq_compile``
    for large files because the source stays on disk (avoids transmitting
    the full text through the MCP transport).

    On failure, the result includes ``error_positions`` and a ``hint``.
    When coq-lsp is available in the active MCP session, the result
    also includes ``state_capture_status``:

      - ``"ok"``: proof state was captured at the error position; the

        succeed; follow the original ``hint`` (typically
        ``rocq_start(file=..., line=..., character=...)``).

    On a ``compile_error`` failure with coq-lsp available, the result
    may also include ``errors``: a list of per-proof errors discovered
    by walking the file through pet (one entry per failing chunk).
    Each entry is ``{proof_name, kind, start_line, end_line, code,
    message}``.  Complements ``error_positions`` — the latter is
    coqc's raw parse of the first diagnostic, while ``errors`` is
    pet's structured walk of the whole file.  The field may be
    *present and empty* (``errors: []``) when the walker ran but pet
    did not reproduce the coqc-reported failure — treat this as "no
    additional errors found" rather than "no errors at all."  Absent
    on success, when coq-lsp is unavailable, when the walker could
    not run, and when ``ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_CAP=0`` (feature
    disabled).  Tune via ``ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_CAP`` (default 20,
    max entries) and ``ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_TIMEOUT`` (default
    5.0s, per-``pet.run`` budget inside the walker).

    Compilation artifacts (``.vo``/``.vok``/``.vos``/``.glob``/``.aux``)
    are cleaned up by default; the source file is preserved.  Set
    ``keep_vo=True`` to retain the compiled-artifact family
    (``.vo``/``.vok``/``.vos``) while still cleaning the diagnostic
    artifacts (``.glob``/``.aux``/``.vio``/``.timing``/``.coqaux``).
    Typical use: compiling a file whose ``.vo`` will be imported by a
    sibling ``.v`` in the same workspace, or incremental compile loops
    that want to avoid rebuilding unchanged dependencies.

    When the call rewrites ``.vo`` files in a workspace that has active
    interactive sessions, the result also includes ``vo_rebuild_warning``:
    a soft advisory naming the workspace and the count of potentially
    affected sessions, with a hint to call ``rocq_start`` again to refresh
    held dependency state.  Quiet when no ``.vo`` changed, when no
    interactive session in this workspace exists, or when the workspace
    exceeds ``_VO_SCAN_FILE_CAP`` (.vo paths).  Setting ``keep_vo=True``
    makes this warning *more likely to fire* on subsequent
    ``rocq_compile_file`` calls in the same workspace: the produced
    ``.vo`` now persists between calls, so any later compile that
    rewrites it is observable as a fresh mtime delta.

    Args:
        file: Path to the .v file (relative to workspace).
        workspace: Workspace directory.  If omitted, auto-detected by walking
            up from *file* looking for ``_RocqProject`` / ``_CoqProject`` /
            ``dune-project``; falls back to the ``ROCQ_WORKSPACE`` env var
            (default: cwd).
        timeout: Compilation timeout in seconds (default: ROCQ_COQC_TIMEOUT env var).
        include_warnings: If True (default), include deduplicated warnings
            before the error in the output.  Set to False to get only the
            error diagnostic, which keeps context compact.
        keep_vo: If True, preserve the ``.vo``/``.vok``/``.vos`` outputs
            after coqc returns (diagnostic artifacts are still cleaned).
            Default False matches today's "clean everything but the
            source" behavior.  Useful when a sibling file in the same
            workspace will ``Require Import`` the result.  **Note**:
            combining ``keep_vo=True`` with ``mode="vos"`` produces
            only a ``.vos`` artifact; downstream files compiled in
            ``mode="full"`` will fail with ``"Unable to locate
            library ... (while searching for a .vos file)"`` — use
            ``mode="full" keep_vo=True`` when the sibling consumer
            expects a ``.vo``.
        mode: Which coqc pass to run.  ``"full"`` (default) is today's
            behavior — coqc fully elaborates every proof body.  ``"vos"``
            adds ``-vos`` so coqc *skips proof bodies entirely* — it
            does NOT execute them.  ``"vos"`` is fast and catches
            missing imports, statement type errors, holes left in
            statements, and notation conflicts.  It does NOT validate
            proofs: a ``Theorem t : False. Proof. exact I. Qed.``
            passes under ``"vos"``.  Use it as a cheap pre-pass during
            iteration, then run ``"full"`` for the real check.
            ``"vos"`` produces a ``.vos`` artifact rather than a ``.vo``.
        timing: If True, invoke coqc with ``-time`` and attach a
            ``timing`` field to the response with per-sentence
            diagnostics — ``{"total_sentences": int, "top_slowest":
            list[{line, characters, name, duration_seconds}],
            "last_completed": {...} | None}``.  ``top_slowest`` holds
            up to 5 entries sorted by descending duration.  On
            timeout, ``last_completed`` is the final sentence coqc
            finished and the ``error`` string names it so "timed out
            after 590s" becomes "Last completed sentence: line 221
            [Theorem.foo] (15.3s)."  On a successful compile,
            ``last_completed`` is the file's literal final sentence
            (not a failure marker).  Default False is zero-overhead.

    The response envelope additionally carries several optional fields
    depending on flags / failure mode: ``error_positions`` and
    ``state_capture_status`` on ``reason="compile_error"`` (see the
    ``state_capture_status`` paragraph above); ``errors`` per-declaration
    list when ``pet`` is available (see the Multi-error callout in the
    README); ``vo_rebuild_warning`` when the call rewrites ``.vo``
    artifacts in a workspace with active sessions; ``clamped_timeout``
    when the per-call timeout was clamped by ``ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP``;
    ``timing`` when ``timing=True``.

    On ``pet_restarted: True`` (state-capture path crashed pet), call
    ``rocq_diag`` for memory headroom and recent error history.

    """Search the Rocq environment — find lemmas, check types, inspect definitions.

    Does NOT modify any proof state. Use this to explore before proving:
      command="Search (nat -> nat -> nat)."  — find relevant lemmas
      command="Check Nat.add."               — check a term's type
      command="Print Nat.add."               — see a definition
      command="About plus."                  — summary of a name

    Three context modes (mutually exclusive in practice):
    - **preamble mode** (default): pass import / scope commands as a
      string.  Scope and import statements like ``Require Import``,
      ``From X Require Y``, ``Open Scope``, ``Set``, ``Unset``,
      ``Local``, and ``Section`` belong here — NOT inside ``command=``.
      ``command=`` runs each statement in isolation, so e.g. an
      ``Open Scope`` placed in ``command`` would not propagate to a
      following ``Search``.  See README "Recommended usage patterns →
      Imports and scopes in rocq_query".
    - **file mode**: pass a ``.v`` file path; the query runs with all
      definitions from that file in scope.  More reliable than preamble
      because it captures ``Open Scope``, ``Set`` options, etc., in the
      exact order the file declares them.
    - **from_state mode**: pass a ``state_id`` from a live ``rocq_check``
      session to query against the live proof context — opened scopes,
      hypotheses, and local definitions are all visible to ``Search`` /
      ``Print`` / ``About`` / ``Locate``.  The query runs against a
      transient child state which is discarded; the parent state is
      unchanged.  Canonical pattern::

          state_id = (await rocq_check(body=..., from_state=...))["state_id"]
          await rocq_query(command="Search _.", from_state=state_id)

      Prefer this over ``rocq_check(from_state=N, body="Search ...")``
      for pure queries — no new ``state_id`` is allocated and the
      state-table is not polluted.

    Args:
        command: The Rocq query command to execute.
        preamble: Optional import lines needed for the query context
                  (e.g., "Require Import Reals.\\nOpen Scope R_scope.").
        file: Path to a .v file (relative to workspace) whose definitions
            should be in scope. Mutually exclusive with preamble and
            from_state.
        workspace: Workspace directory.  If omitted, auto-detected by walking
            up from *file* looking for ``_RocqProject`` / ``_CoqProject`` /
            ``dune-project``; falls back to the ``ROCQ_WORKSPACE`` env var
            (default: cwd).
        max_results: Optional maximum number of results to return.
            Useful for broad Search patterns. If omitted, all results are
            returned (subject to character limit).
        include_warnings: If True (default), include all feedback returned
            by the query.  If False, drop entries at LSP Warning severity
            so warning noise does not crowd out tool output.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds for expensive computations
            like ``Time Eval vm_compute in ...``.  ``0`` (default) means
            use ``ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT``.  Clamped to ``ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP``
            (default 300s); when clamping fires the response includes
            ``clamped_timeout: <cap>`` so the caller can diagnose unexpected
            timeouts.
        from_state: A live state_id (from ``rocq_start`` / ``rocq_check`` /
            ``rocq_step_multi``) to query against.  Mutually exclusive with
            *file*.  When set, *preamble* is ignored.

    — this tool is pure introspection; the agent decides what's safe to
    trust.  Use ``rocq_verify`` for an admit-free / sandboxed trust
    decision on a candidate proof.

    The theorem must be defined in the given file.  The tool reads the file
    to set up the full Rocq environment (imports, scopes, definitions),
    ensuring the correct theorem is resolved even when names are reused
    across sections.

    Args:
        name: The theorem/lemma name to check (e.g., "add_comm").

            query.  Default 0 uses ``ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT`` (env var, default
            30).  Raise this when the theorem's opaque-proof fetch from
            ``.vo`` files is slow.  Clamped to ``ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP``
            (default 300s) so a stray large value cannot park the pet
            lock indefinitely; when clamping fires the response includes
            ``clamped_timeout: <cap>`` so the caller can diagnose
            unexpected timeouts.

            **Tip:** ``Print Assumptions`` triggers ``.vo`` opaque-proof
            fetching on first call (often 40+ modules on heavy library
            imports).  A pet restart from a timeout wipes Fleche, so a
            retry with the *same* timeout pays the same opaque-fetch
            cost from scratch and will time out again — the cost
            survives ``pet_restarted: True``.  Set ``timeout=`` high on
            the *first* call rather than relying on a retry after
            restart.

    Returns (key fields):
        success:     bool.
        theorem:     the cleaned theorem name.
        assumptions: list[str] of ``"name : type"`` pairs from
                     ``Print Assumptions``.  Empty when the theorem is closed
                     under the global context.  ``Print Assumptions`` does
                     not distinguish ``Admitted`` from ``Axiom`` / ``Parameter``

    """Start an interactive proof session — see goals, explore tactics.

    Returns a state_id for use with rocq_check and rocq_step_multi.
    Also returns the current proof goals at the starting position,
    so this tool can be used to inspect goals at any point in a file.
    For a position inside a proof, the response also carries
    ``focus_depth`` — how many ``{...}`` / bullet focus frames are open
    above the goal (0 at the top level) — so a session resumed mid-proof
    knows its bullet nesting (omitted for preamble-only starts).

    Three start modes (precedence: theorem > position > preamble):
    1. By theorem: file + theorem — start proving a specific theorem.
       Tip: for a scratch file under ``/tmp`` that needs the project's
       load path, keep the file name stable across iterations (e.g.
       ``/tmp/probe.v``) — Fleche caches per file path, so rotating
       probe names defeats the warmth.
    2. By position: file + line + character — jump to any position in
       a file and see the proof goals there.  Useful for inspecting
       proof state at a specific point, or recovering from an error
       position returned by rocq_compile.
    3. From imports: preamble — set up an import context only.
       **Preferred for scratch iteration** (no project files needed,
       preferred over ``coqc /tmp/foo.v``): call
       ``rocq_start(preamble='Require Import ...')`` once, then iterate
       with rocq_check / rocq_step_multi against the returned state_id.
       The import set is content-hashed and warm across iterations even
       if you change the lemma body (see
       ``interactive.py:_get_or_create_import_state``).

    **Position semantics (mode 2):** ``line`` and ``character`` are
    0-indexed.  Petanque resolves the cursor to a sentence boundary by
    *rounding forward* through the sentence that contains the cursor:

    - Cursor on any character of a sentence — its first letter, any
      character inside, or its terminating period — yields the state
      **after** that whole sentence has executed.
    - Cursor in the whitespace **before** a sentence's first
      non-whitespace character yields the state **before** that
      sentence (= after the previous sentence).
    - Cursor in the whitespace **after** a sentence's terminating
      period yields the state **after** that sentence.

    So to inspect goals **before** a tactic, point at the whitespace
    just before its first character.  To inspect goals **after** a
    tactic, point at any character of the tactic (including its
    period) or at the whitespace immediately following the period.

    **Important:** The interactive session reads the file at start time and
    does not track subsequent edits. If another process or agent modifies the
    file while a session is active, the proof state becomes stale and tactics
    may fail or produce wrong results. To avoid this, work on a **copy** of
    the file for interactive proving, or restart the session after edits.

    Args:
        file: Path to the .v file (relative to workspace).
        theorem: Name of the theorem to prove.
        workspace: Workspace directory.  If omitted, auto-detected by walking

            ``dune-project``; falls back to the ``ROCQ_WORKSPACE`` env var
            (default: cwd).
        line: 0-based line number for position-based start.  See
            "Position semantics" above for how the cursor is resolved
            to a sentence boundary.
        character: 0-based character offset for position-based start.
            See "Position semantics" above.
        preamble: Import commands for preamble mode (e.g., "Require Import Lia.").
        force_restart: If True, kill pet, clear the state table, and
            respawn before starting.  Recovery primitive for the rare
            cases where the shared pet is in a bad state: accumulated
            RAM bloat after long shared use, indexing corruption, or a
            "State N expired" that repeats after a plain ``rocq_start``
            retry (suggesting a peer caller is also force-restarting).
            Actively-used states survive peer churn via LRU eviction —
            ``force_restart=True`` is *not* needed as routine insurance
            and is unhelpful when a recent response already carried
            ``pet_restarted: True`` (pet is already fresh).  See README
            "Concurrency model".  Default: False.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds for opening the session.
            Default 0 uses ``ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT`` (env var, default 30).

    Or to auto-solve a subgoal, try the standard automation battery:
      tactics=["trivial.", "reflexivity.", "assumption.", "exact I.",
               "auto.", "eauto.", "tauto.", "intuition.", "lia.", "lra.",
               "nia.", "nra.", "ring.", "field.", "decide equality.",
               "firstorder."]
    Note: lia/lra/ring/field require the .v file to import Lia/Lra/Ring/Field.

    Or to explore proof structure:
      tactics=["destruct n.", "induction n.", "case_eq n."]

    Each result entry includes a ``feedback`` field (truncated string)
    when the tactic produces visible output (e.g., ``Print``, ``Search``).
    Each *successful* entry also carries a ``focus_depth`` field — how
    many ``{...}`` / bullet focus frames that tactic leaves open above
    the goal (0 at the top level).

    **Canonical exploration pattern:** if the first few steps of a proof
    are a confident prefix, advance with ``rocq_check`` first and pass
    the resulting ``state_id`` as ``from_state`` here — don't repeat the
    prefix inside every entry of ``tactics``.  See README
    "Recommended usage patterns → Multi-tactic exploration".

    Args:
        tactics: List of tactics to try (max 20).
        from_state: State ID to try the tactics from.  Required — use the
            ``state_id`` returned by ``rocq_start`` or a previous
            ``rocq_check``.  There is no implicit "current state"
            fallback (avoids cross-agent state confusion when peers
            share this rocq-mcp process).
        include_warnings: If True (default), per-tactic ``feedback`` includes
            all severities.  If False, drop entries at LSP Warning severity.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds for the whole batch.  The
            per-tactic budget is ``timeout / len(tactics)`` (subject to the
            usual ``Timeout`` eligibility rules).  Default 0 uses
            ``ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT`` (env var, default 30).  Raise this when
            individual tactics in the batch are expensive.  Clamped to
            ``ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP``
            (default 300s) so a stray large value cannot park the pet
            lock indefinitely; when clamping fires the response includes
            ``clamped_timeout: <cap>`` so the caller can diagnose
            unexpected timeouts.

    On ``pet_restarted: True``, call ``rocq_diag`` for memory headroom and
    recent error history.

    """Run proof commands from cached imports — fast iterative checking.

    Much faster than rocq_compile for iterative proof development:
    imports are cached (first call processes them, subsequent calls skip), and on error
    returns the last valid state for immediate interactive recovery
    via rocq_check(from_state=...) or rocq_step_multi(from_state=...).

    When proof_finished=True, also returns proof_tactics (ordered list of
    all tactics from root to current state) and proof_hint (instructions
    for assembling the final .v file).  On a broken walk (an ancestor
    state was LRU-evicted, or a cycle was detected), proof_tactics and
    proof_hint are omitted; the response carries ``proof_tactics_status``
    (``"ancestor_evicted"`` or ``"cycle"``), ``proof_tactics_broken_at``
    (the state id where the walk gave up), and ``proof_tactics_hint``
    instead — clients that ignore these keys see no half-chain at all.

    Recommended workflow (each step threads ``state_id`` explicitly):
    1. ``s0 = rocq_start(file=..., theorem=...)["state_id"]``
    2. ``s1 = rocq_check(from_state=s0, body="intros. simpl.")["state_id"]``
    3. If stuck: ``rocq_step_multi(from_state=s1, tactics=[...])`` to explore
    4. ``rocq_check(from_state=s1, body="winning_tactic.")`` to commit

    When commands produce visible output (e.g., ``Print``, ``Check``,
    ``vm_compute``, ``native_compute``), a ``feedback`` field is included
    as a list of ``[command, output]`` pairs (truncated per step at 50K
    chars).  Omitted when no command produces output.

    When proof goals are available, the success response carries
    ``focus_depth`` — how many ``{...}`` / bullet focus frames are
    currently open above the goal (0 at the top level) — so an agent
    stepping through nested subgoals can tell how deep its focus nesting
    is.  (Omitted on empty-body checks and when goal state cannot be
    retrieved, like the other goal-derived fields.)

    **Note:** If the underlying .v file is modified after rocq_start, the
    session state becomes stale. A ``stale_warning`` field is returned when
    this is detected. Restart the session with rocq_start after file edits.

    Args:
        body: Commands to execute (one or more Rocq sentences).
        from_state: State ID to execute from.  Required — use the
            ``state_id`` returned by ``rocq_start`` or a previous
            ``rocq_check``.  There is no implicit "current state"
            fallback (avoids cross-agent state confusion when peers
            share this rocq-mcp process).
        workspace: Accepted for API compatibility but unused; the
            active workspace comes from the state entry set by
            ``rocq_start``.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds for the batch of commands.
            Default 0 uses ``ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT`` (env var, default 30).
            Raise this for compute-heavy tactics (``vm_compute``,
            ``native_compute``).  Clamped to ``ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP``
            (default 300s) so a stray large value cannot park the pet
            lock indefinitely; when clamping fires the response includes
            ``clamped_timeout: <cap>`` so the caller can diagnose

    Use this when:
    - A tool returned ``pet_restarted: True`` and you want to see what
      happened.
    - You're considering a long ``vm_compute`` and want to check memory
      headroom against ``max_rss_mb_threshold``.
    - You want to know which proof states are currently live in pet's
      state table.
    - You suspect another agent is sharing this rocq-mcp process.
      Heuristic: compare ``live_states[*].file`` against the files you
      opened this session — entries you did not create signal a foreign
      caller (works only when agents are on disjoint files).  Actively
      used states are LRU-protected against peer churn, so sharing is
      mostly a latency and RAM concern; if repeated state expiries
      survive that floor, ``rocq_start(..., force_restart=True)`` is
      the recovery — see README "Concurrency model".

    Does NOT spawn pet if it's not running; just reports state.

    Response shape:

    - ``server_version``: the rocq-mcp package version (from
      ``importlib.metadata``).  Include in bug reports.
    - ``pet``: ``{pid, uptime_seconds, restarts, generation}``
    - ``memory``: ``{pet_rss_mb, peak_pet_rss_mb, max_rss_mb_threshold,
      sample_status}`` where ``sample_status`` is one of ``"ok"`` /
      ``"no_pet"`` / ``"psutil_error"`` and disambiguates a ``None``
      ``pet_rss_mb``.
    - ``load_average``: ``{"1m": float, "5m": float, "15m": float}`` —
      kernel-tracked system load averages over the last 1, 5, and 15
      minutes (from ``os.getloadavg()``).  ``None`` on platforms without
      an equivalent (e.g. Windows).  Use this to disambiguate CPU
      contention from tactic divergence when a timeout fires.
    - ``live_states``: capped at 50 most-recent entries (by
      ``created_at``) to keep the payload bounded.  Each entry has
      ``{state_id, parent, file, theorem, age_seconds}``.
    - ``live_states_total``: full count of entries in the state table
      (use this to detect that ``live_states`` was truncated).
    - ``recent_errors``: ring buffer of the last 20 errors, each
      ``{tool, message, reason, ago_seconds}``.  ``reason`` is one of:

      - **Pet-side** (set by ``_run_with_pet``): ``"timeout"``,
        ``"crashed"``, ``"memory_exhausted"``, ``"lock_contended"``,
        ``"unavailable"``.
      - **Validation / lookup** (set by tools before pet): ``"validation"``,
        ``"not_found"`` (rocq_start / rocq_assumptions on a typo).
      - **rocq_check mid-batch**: ``"tactic_failed"`` (a tactic was
        rejected by Coq — distinct from a transport-level ``"crashed"``).
      - **rocq_verify-specific**: ``"compile_error"``,
        ``"axiom_dependency"``, ``"type_mismatch"``.

      do its core job).  Interactive capability is reported separately under

    - ``server_version``: the rocq-mcp package version.
    - ``switch``: the active switch name (e.g. ``"rocq9"``), or the project
      path for a local ``_opam`` switch, or ``None`` for a non-opam install.
    - ``switch_prefix``: the resolved ``OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX``-style path
      (``None`` when no switch was identified).
    - ``switch_is_local``: ``True`` for a project-local (``_opam``) switch.

      (from ``$OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX``, authoritative), ``"binary_path"``

      (non-opam / unrecognised layout).

      pytanque, or a switch that could not be identified).

      the old switch may fail to ``Require`` under the new one
      (``Compiled library ... makes inconsistent assumptions``). Recompile
      dependencies after switching.
    - **Process-global.** The change affects the whole server process, so
      *every* agent sharing this rocq-mcp instance is moved to the new
      switch. Do not use in a shared multi-agent setup without coordination:
      call ``rocq_diag`` first and check its ``live_states`` to confirm no
      peer has an in-flight session before switching.
    - For a stable per-deployment switch, prefer pinning it at launch in the

      server ``command``) rather than switching at runtime.
