interactive session (pet/coq-lsp) that keeps imports warm across calls.

Core proof loop: rocq_start (returns a state_id) -> rocq_step_multi to \
explore candidate tactics (read-only) -> rocq_check to commit the winner \
(returns a new state_id) -> write the finished proof into the .v file -> \
rocq_compile_file + rocq_verify (and rocq_assumptions for an axiom audit) \
to finish. Never iterate by re-running coqc on a scratch file: coqc \
reloads every import per call; the interactive session does not.

State rules: rocq_check and rocq_step_multi require an explicit \
from_state (a state_id from rocq_start or a previous rocq_check). States \
live in a process-global LRU table; states you keep using stay alive. If \
a state_id goes missing, restart the session with rocq_start.

Failures: every failure response is {success: false, error, reason}. \
Dispatch on reason, not on message text; reason is one of: validation, \
not_found, timeout, crashed, memory_exhausted, lock_contended, \
unavailable, tactic_failed, query_rejected, compile_error, \
axiom_dependency, type_mismatch. When a response carries pet_restarted: true, call \
rocq_diag to see what happened.

Timeouts: timeout=0 means "use the server default"; larger per-call \
values are clamped to a server cap and the response then carries \
clamped_timeout.

    Runs the boilerplate every pet-routed / coqc-routed wrapper repeats:

    1. ctx-check first — for pet-routed tools, a missing context is a
       programmer error and is reported as the no-ctx envelope without
       touching the workspace (``_no_ctx_fail``).  Pins the order so a
       bad workspace + no-ctx caller gets the no-ctx envelope, not a
       silent validation failure that ``recent_errors`` never sees.
       Coqc-routed tools (``rocq_compile`` / ``rocq_compile_file`` /
       ``rocq_verify``) pass ``ctx_optional=True``: they can run without
       an MCP context — ``lifespan_state`` falls through as ``None`` and
       the ``recent_errors`` recording is silently skipped.
    2. Workspace resolution: explicit > project-marker walk-up from
       *file* (when *file* is non-empty) > ``config.ROCQ_WORKSPACE``.
    3. Timeout resolution.  *timeout_default* is the wrapper's
       compile/verify fallback (seconds): when set, the helper
       falls back to it for ``timeout<=0`` and does not clamp; when
       ``None`` the helper routes through :func:`_resolve_call_timeout`
       (the per-call cap that returns a ``clamped`` flag).
    4. ``_workspace._validate_workspace`` against the resolved workspace; on
       failure returns a :func:`_fail` envelope with the *already
       resolved* lifespan_state so the failure lands in
       ``recent_errors``.
    5. ``_workspace._maybe_workspace_warning`` against the resolved workspace.

    Returns either a failure envelope (caller returns it verbatim) or
    the tuple ``(workspace, lifespan_state, ws_warning, clamped,
    effective_timeout)``.

    The helper encapsulates the full boilerplate shared by every pytanque
    operation that follows the simple "acquire lock, ensure pet, do work"
    pattern:

    1. PetanqueError import check
    2. _pet_lock acquisition with timeout
    3. _ensure_pet (lazy-init the pet subprocess)
    4. asyncio.Semaphore + asyncio.wait_for (async-level timeout)
    5. All standard exception handlers

    *fn* receives the live pet client and must return the desired result.
    It runs inside a background thread with _pet_lock held; the lock is
    released automatically when *fn* returns or raises.

    *tool* is the canonical MCP tool name (e.g. ``"rocq_check"``) and is
    used both as the prefix in user-facing error messages
    (``"rocq_check timed out after 30s."``) and as the ``tool`` field on
    ``recent_errors`` entries.  Pass exactly the public tool name, not a
    human phrase.

    When pet crashes (timeout, broken pipe), the return dict includes
    ``"pet_restarted": True`` so callers can decide whether to retry.

    If *partial_state* is given (a mutable dict), *fn* can populate it
    with intermediate results.  On timeout or error the dict contents
    are merged into the error response so partial work is not lost.

    When *auto_record* is False (default True), failure paths still
    return the same failure-envelope dict but skip the ``_record_error``
    push into ``recent_errors``.  Callers that need to classify the
    failure at their own layer (e.g. ``run_assumptions`` distinguishing
    ``not_found`` from a generic ``rocq_query/crashed``) pass
    ``auto_record=False`` to avoid the double-record / compensating-pop
    dance.

    The return type is left as ``Any`` because the dict shape varies by
    failure mode (success path, ``pet_restarted``-tagged crashes,
    ``partial_state`` merges, etc.) and a TypedDict would be unwieldy.
    The ``"reason"`` key, when present on a failure, is a
    :data:`compile_enrichment._StateCaptureStatus` (one of ``"timeout"``, ``"crashed"``,
    ``"memory_exhausted"``, ``"lock_contended"``, ``"unavailable"``).

Prove the theorem `{theorem}` in `{file}` using the rocq-mcp tools.

Method — use the held interactive session, never a coqc loop:
1. Read `rocq://guide/workflows` if you have not already.
2. `rocq_toc(file="{file}")` if you need to confirm the theorem name.
3. `s = rocq_start(file="{file}", theorem="{theorem}")` — read the goals.
4. Explore with `rocq_step_multi(from_state=s, tactics=[...])`.  Start
   with the automation battery: ["trivial.", "reflexivity.",
   "assumption.", "auto.", "eauto.", "tauto.", "intuition.", "lia.",
   "lra.", "ring.", "firstorder."] (lia/lra/ring need the matching
   imports), then structural steps ("intros.", "induction x.",
   "destruct x.", "simpl.") as the goals demand.
5. Commit each winning step with `rocq_check(from_state=..., body=...)`
   and continue from the returned state_id.  On tactic_failed, continue
   from last_valid_state_id — do not restart.
6. When proof_finished is true: write the finished proof into the file
   (imports + statement + Proof. + the proof_tactics + Qed.), then run
   `rocq_compile_file` and `rocq_verify`, and audit axioms with
   `rocq_assumptions(name="{theorem}", file="{file}")`.

Report: the final proof script, the verification verdict, and any
axioms the proof depends on."""

    return f"""\
The file `{file}` fails to compile.  Diagnose and fix it with rocq-mcp.

Method:
1. `rocq_compile_file(file="{file}")` — read `reason`,
   `error_positions`, and (if present) the per-declaration `errors`
   list to see every failing declaration, not just the first.
2. If the response carries `state_capture_status: "ok"`, continue
   directly from the captured proof state:
   `rocq_step_multi(from_state=<state_id>, tactics=[...])` /
   `rocq_check(from_state=<state_id>, ...)`.  Otherwise open the error
   position yourself: `rocq_start(file="{file}", line=<line>,
   character=<char>)` (0-indexed; see rocq://guide/failures).
3. Find a working replacement for the broken step, edit the file, and
   recompile.  Repeat for each entry in `errors`.
4. Finish with a clean `rocq_compile_file` run — and `rocq_verify` if
   the fix touched a proof of a stated problem.

Report: each error found, the fix applied, and the final compile
status."""
