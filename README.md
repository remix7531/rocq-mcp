An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) (formerly Coq) proof development. It exposes compilation, verification, querying, and interactive tactic stepping as MCP tools, so that LLM agents can write and check Rocq proofs.

- **Fifteen MCP tools** backed by [pet](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp) (Rocq's coq-lsp interactive backend).
- **Interactive tools.** Inspect proof goals, search the environment, step through tactics.
- **Staged verification.** Sandboxed audit of admits, axioms, and statement mismatches.
- **State is cached across calls** for fast iteration.

> **A note on this README.** The sections that follow are detailed reference documentation aimed primarily at **AI agents** consuming these tools (and the human operators briefing them).

## Prerequisites

- **Rocq / Coq** -- `coqc` must be on your `PATH`. If the workspace contains a `_RocqProject` or `_CoqProject` file, the server parses it for load-path flags (`-Q`, `-R`, `-I`). For **dune projects** (no `_CoqProject` but a `dune-project` file present), the server auto-detects load paths via `dune coq top` (once per `(coq.theory ...)` stanza, so multi-theory workspaces resolve cross-theory imports correctly) and writes a `_RocqProject` file in the workspace so that coq-lsp also picks them up. This generated file stays in the workspace and should be added to `.gitignore`. Otherwise it defaults to `-Q <workspace> Test`.
- **pet** (from [coq-lsp](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp)) -- **recommended**. Powers the interactive tools (`rocq_query`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_start`, `rocq_check`, `rocq_step_multi`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_notations`) and the proof-state enrichment / multi-error walker on `rocq_compile_file`. Without `pet` you fall back to `coqc`-only operation: `rocq_compile`, `rocq_compile_file` (first error only, no goals), `rocq_verify`, `rocq_diag`, `rocq_health`, `rocq_switch` — a substantial reduction in what an agent can do.
- **Python 3.11+**

## Installation

```bash
# Install (includes pytanque for interactive tools)
uv pip install -e .
```

For development (includes pytest):

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Tools

The server exposes thirteen MCP tools:

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: tools (scripts/gen_docs.py) -->
| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **`rocq_compile`** | Compile Rocq source from a string buffer via coqc. |
| **`rocq_compile_file`** | Compile a .v file on disk via coqc — whole-file check and final verification. |
| **`rocq_verify`** | Verify a proof proves the original statement — sandboxed admit/axiom/statement check. |
| **`rocq_query`** | Run a raw Rocq query (Check / Print / About / Locate / Search) and return its output. |
| **`rocq_assumptions`** | List the axioms a theorem depends on (Print Assumptions), parsed. |
| **`rocq_toc`** | Outline a .v file: definitions, lemmas, theorems, and sections as a hierarchy. |
| **`rocq_notations`** | Resolve every notation in a statement: which notation, scope, and module. |
| **`rocq_start`** | Open an interactive proof session; returns a state_id plus the goals there. |
| **`rocq_step_multi`** | Try up to 20 tactics against one state; report each outcome without committing. |
| **`rocq_check`** | Run proof commands from a held state; returns a new state_id — the commit step. |
| **`rocq_diag`** | Server runtime diagnostics: pet health, memory, lock contention, recent errors. |
| **`rocq_health`** | Toolchain health: is coqc resolvable, and which opam switch is this server on? |
| **`rocq_switch`** | Switch the running server to another opam switch — process-global and destructive. |
| **`rocq_search`** | Search the environment for lemmas/definitions matching a pattern — structured hits. |
| **`rocq_goal`** | Show proof goals at a live state_id or a file position — registers no state. |
<!-- END GENERATED: tools -->

> **Switch selection:** The server resolves `coqc` and `pet` from the `PATH` / opam environment of **the process Claude Code (or your MCP client) launched** — *not* from your interactive shell. So the switch is fixed at server-launch time and can silently differ from `opam switch show` in your terminal. Pin it explicitly in the MCP client config, e.g. register the server command as `opam exec --switch=<name> -- uv run --directory <repo> rocq-mcp`, or set `env: { … }` (PATH / OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX). Call `rocq_health` to see the switch the server is actually on. To change it: either edit the launch command and reconnect the MCP server (`/mcp` → reconnect, or restart the client), or call `rocq_switch(name=…)` to swap in-session — the latter clears all live `state_id`s and may leave `.vo` artifacts ABI-incompatible, so prefer the launch-time pin for a stable setup.

> **Stale file warning:** Interactive sessions (`rocq_start` / `rocq_check` / `rocq_step_multi`) read the `.v` file at session start and do not track subsequent edits. If another process or agent modifies the file while a session is active, the proof state becomes stale and tactics may fail or produce wrong results. In multi-agent setups, **work on a copy of the file** for interactive proving, or restart the session with `rocq_start` after edits. A `stale_warning` field is returned when a file modification is detected. See also the [Concurrency model](#concurrency-model) section below.

> **Workspace auto-detection:** When a file-accepting tool (`rocq_compile_file`, `rocq_query`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_start`) is called without an explicit `workspace`, the server walks up from the file's directory looking for `_RocqProject`, `_CoqProject`, or `dune-project` markers and uses the directory of the innermost match. Falls back to `ROCQ_WORKSPACE` if no marker is found. Pass `workspace=` explicitly to override (e.g. for monorepos with nested project files).

> **Workspace warning:** When the resolved workspace contains no `_RocqProject` / `_CoqProject` / `dune-project` marker AND the call provided explicit `workspace=` or a `file=` hint, the response carries `workspace_warning: str` advising on the load-path resolution. Source-string tools without `workspace=` / `file=` (the legitimate scratch / one-off workflow) stay quiet.

> **.vo rebuild warning:** When `rocq_compile_file` rewrites `.vo` artifacts in a workspace that has one or more active interactive sessions (`rocq_start` / `rocq_check` / `rocq_step_multi`), the response carries `vo_rebuild_warning: str` advising the other agents to call `rocq_start` again to refresh held dependency state. Quiet when no `.vo` changed, when no interactive session lives in this workspace, or when the workspace exceeds the internal scan cap. *Calling `rocq_compile_file` with `keep_vo=True` makes the `.vo` persist between calls, so subsequent compiles of the same file are more likely to trip this warning.*

> **Multi-error reporting:** When `rocq_compile_file` fails (`reason: "compile_error"`) and `pet` is available, the response carries `errors: list[dict]` with per-declaration entries (`proof_name`, `kind`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `code`, `message`) covering errors in named declarations and top-level vernaculars (broken `Require`, broken `Notation`, etc.) reached via inter-chunk regions. This surfaces additional errors beyond the first one coqc reports; cascade failures within a single proof body are deduplicated. Collection stops at `ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_CAP` (default 20; set to `0` to disable). The field can be present and **empty** (`errors: []`) when the walker ran but pet did not reproduce the coqc-reported failure — treat it as "no additional errors found" rather than "no errors at all." Quiet on successful compiles, when `pet` is unavailable, and on source-string `rocq_compile` (this feature is `rocq_compile_file` only).

> **Compile-file options:** `rocq_compile_file` accepts three opt-in tuning kwargs. All default off — pure additions, no behavior change to the baseline call.
>
> - **`keep_vo=True`** preserves the produced `.vo`/`.vok`/`.vos` artifacts. Useful when a sibling file `Require`s the result; the default behavior is to clean every artifact except the source `.v`. *Combining `keep_vo=True` with `mode="vos"` produces only a `.vos`* — downstream full-mode `Require Import` will then fail with `"Unable to locate library ... (.vos file)"`. Use `keep_vo=True` with `mode="full"` when the sibling consumer expects a `.vo`.
> - **`mode="vos"`** selects a fast statements-only pre-pass (`coqc -vos`). Skips proof bodies *entirely* — does NOT execute them — so it catches missing imports, statement type errors, holes, and notation conflicts in seconds, but accepts any proof body (`Theorem t : False. Proof. exact I. Qed.` passes under `"vos"`). Use as a cheap pre-pass during iteration, then run `mode="full"` for the real check.
> - **`timing=True`** runs coqc with `-time` and adds a `timing: {total_sentences, top_slowest, last_completed}` response field carrying per-sentence diagnostics; `top_slowest` is capped at 5 by descending duration. On timeout, `last_completed` is woven into the error string: `"timed out after 590s. Last completed sentence: line 221 [Theorem.foo] (15.3s)"`. On a successful compile, `last_completed` is the file's literal final sentence (not a failure marker).

> **Proof-tactics chain status:** When a `rocq_check` call finishes a proof (`proof_finished: True`), the server walks the LRU state table backward from the leaf to reconstruct `proof_tactics`. If an ancestor state was LRU-evicted, or (defensively) a cycle is detected, the walk cannot complete; the response then **omits** `proof_tactics` and `proof_hint` and carries `proof_tactics_status` (`"ancestor_evicted"` or `"cycle"`), `proof_tactics_broken_at: int` (the state id where the walk gave up), and a short `proof_tactics_hint` instead. Clients that ignore these keys see no half-chain — they never render a partial walk as a finished proof.

> **Per-call timeout clamp:** When any pet-routed tool (`rocq_query`, `rocq_start`, `rocq_step_multi`, `rocq_check`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_notations`) is invoked with `timeout=<seconds>` exceeding `ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP` (default 300), the call runs with the cap as the actual budget and the response carries `clamped_timeout: <cap>`. The `timeout=` parameter is the user's request; `clamped_timeout` is the server-side ceiling.

### Choosing a tool

The tools table above is reference-style.  This subsection is intent → tool: find the row that matches what you want to do, then read its tool's full entry above for details.

| If you want to... | Use |
|---|---|
| Iteratively develop a single proof, trying tactics | `rocq_start` + `rocq_check` / `rocq_step_multi` |
| Inspect proof state at a specific line / character | `rocq_start(file=..., line=..., character=...)` — cursor rounds forward through its sentence; point at whitespace **before** a sentence for state-before |
| Search for a lemma by pattern (e.g. `Search _.`) | `rocq_query` |
| Compile a finished `.v` file (whole-file check, axiom audit) | `rocq_compile_file` |
| Compile a finished proof from a string buffer | `rocq_compile` |
| **Probe a scratch file in `/tmp`** | `rocq_start(file='/tmp/probe.v', theorem=...)` — **never `coqc /tmp/probe.v`** (coqc reloads all imports each call; `rocq_start` keeps them warm) |
| Verify a proof matches its stated theorem | `rocq_verify` |
| Audit which axioms a proof depends on | `rocq_assumptions` |
| List definitions / lemmas in a file | `rocq_toc` |
| List notations available at a position | `rocq_notations` |
| Check pet health, memory, recent errors | `rocq_diag` |
| Check the server is OK & which opam switch it runs on | `rocq_health` |
| Change the server's opam switch in-session | `rocq_switch` |

## Agent documentation

This README covers installing and operating the server. The **agent-facing
documentation ships inside the server itself**:

- **Server instructions** (auto-loaded into the model's context): the core
  proof loop, the explicit-`from_state` rule, the failure envelope and its
  `reason` taxonomy, timeout semantics.
- **Guides** (MCP resources, fetched on demand; `@`-mentionable in Claude
  Code):
  - `rocq://guide/workflows` — choosing a tool, proof patterns, query
    import/scope rules, scratch iteration, position semantics, sub-agent
    briefing.
  - `rocq://guide/failures` — the recovery playbook for every failure
    `reason`, `state_capture_status`, typo recovery, the `pet_restarted`
    diagnostics playbook.
  - `rocq://guide/concurrency` — sharing one server between agents,
    per-instance isolation (named-server pool + git worktree),
    `rocq_switch` caveats.
  - `rocq://guide/responses` — field-level response reference, truncation
    caps, size-control parameters.
- **Prompts** (slash commands in Claude Code): `prove_theorem(file,
  theorem)` and `debug_compile_error(file)` package the recommended
  workflows.

Every failure response carries `{success: false, error, reason}` with a
fixed 12-value `reason` taxonomy — agents dispatch on `reason`, never on
message text: `validation`, `not_found`, `timeout`, `crashed`,
`memory_exhausted`, `lock_contended`, `unavailable`, `tactic_failed`,
`query_rejected`, `compile_error`, `axiom_dependency`, `type_mismatch`.

## Recommended usage patterns

### Multi-tactic exploration: `rocq_check` then `rocq_step_multi`

To explore N alternative tactics from a known good state, advance the
state with `rocq_check` first, then branch with `rocq_step_multi`:

    # Step 1: confirm the prefix and advance.
    result = rocq_check(from_state=S, body="intros n m H.")
    new_state = result["state_id"]

    # Step 2: try alternatives from that state.
    rocq_step_multi(from_state=new_state, tactics=[
        "by ring.",
        "by lia.",
        "by reflexivity.",
    ])

This is more efficient than passing the prefix repeatedly inside
`tactics=[...]` (each tactic would re-run the prefix).  It also makes
the agent's intent — "I'm confident in the prefix; explore the next
step" — explicit.

### Imports and scopes in `rocq_query`

Statements like `Require Import`, `From X Require Y`, `Open Scope`,
`Set`, `Unset`, `Local`, and `Section` must go in the `preamble=`
parameter (a multi-line string), not in `body=`:

    rocq_query(
        preamble="From Coq Require Import Reals.\nOpen Scope R_scope.",
        command="Search (_ + _).",
    )

Why: each statement in `body=` runs in isolation, so `Open Scope`
in body would not propagate to the next statement.  For multi-import
preambles, prefer `file=<path>` to a `.v` file containing the imports
— more reliable when the imports include `Set` / `Unset` directives
that may need a specific ordering.

For mid-proof queries — e.g. `Search` against the live proof state —
use `from_state=<state_id>` instead of preamble; the live state
already has all imports and scopes set up.

### Failure envelope and `reason` taxonomy

Every failure response carries `{success: False, error: str, reason: str}` so an agent can dispatch on `reason` without parsing message text. The same `reason` is recorded into the `recent_errors` ring buffer that `rocq_diag` returns. Values:

- **Validation / lookup** (set by tools before reaching `pet`): `"validation"`, `"not_found"` (typo on `rocq_start` / `rocq_assumptions`).
- **Pet-side** (set by `_run_with_pet` on subprocess-level failures): `"timeout"`, `"crashed"`, `"memory_exhausted"`, `"lock_contended"`, `"unavailable"`. When pet had to be killed, the response also carries `pet_restarted: True`.
- **`rocq_check` mid-batch**: `"tactic_failed"` (Coq rejected the tactic — distinct from a transport-level `"crashed"`).
- **`rocq_compile` / `rocq_compile_file`**: `"compile_error"` (coqc returned non-zero).
- **`rocq_verify`-specific**: `"compile_error"`, `"axiom_dependency"` (proof relies on `Admitted`/admit/custom axiom), `"type_mismatch"` (Phase 3 found the proof's type differs from the problem's type).

When a tool returns `pet_restarted: True`, call `rocq_diag` for memory headroom and recent-error history.

### Concurrency model

*Background (both audiences):* `rocq-mcp` is **single-tenant per process**.  All agent-facing state — the live `state_id` table, the import cache, the active workspace, and the single `pet` subprocess — is process-global.  Two correctness floors keep concurrent sessions from clobbering each other:

- **LRU-protected state table.** A `state_id` you keep querying via `from_state` will not be evicted by a peer caller churning through new states (see `ROCQ_MAX_STATES`).
- **No implicit current state.** `rocq_check` and `rocq_step_multi` require `from_state` explicitly — there is no global "last touched" state a peer could re-point under you.

The remaining cross-agent costs are pure latency: workspace-swap thrash when peers are on different workspaces, pet RAM growth from accumulated Fleche cache, and the rare case of a peer calling `force_restart=True` (which kills pet under everyone).  A second process-global mutator is `rocq_switch`, which moves the *whole* server to a different opam switch — killing pet and clearing the state table for everyone, and potentially invalidating in-flight `.vo` artifacts.  It is a deliberate operator action rather than incidental contention, but in a shared session check `rocq_diag`'s `live_states` for peer entries before calling it (see the **Switch selection** callout).

**Agent-side recovery: `rocq_start(..., force_restart=True)`.**  When a `state_id` you actively depend on goes missing despite the LRU floor — typically because a peer just force-restarted pet — `rocq_start` with `force_restart=True` is the recovery.  This kills pet, clears the state table, respawns a fresh pet, and returns a new `state_id`.  Note that "fresh" is point-in-time: a different concurrent caller can `force_restart` again right after, so this is recovery, not enforced isolation.  For non-contention triggers (RAM bloat, indexing corruption) the same call applies.

**Orchestrator-side monitoring: `rocq_diag`.**  When you cannot deploy a separate `rocq-mcp` per sub-agent (see the Claude Code escape hatch below for one workaround), `rocq_diag` is the natural primitive for spotting cross-agent interference.  Useful checks between sub-agent dispatches: `live_states[*].file` shows entries created by peer callers (sharing signal when agents are on disjoint files); `memory.pet_rss_mb` against `max_rss_mb_threshold` catches accumulated Fleche bloat before it forces a restart; `recent_errors` shows whether a peer just hit `lock_contended` / `memory_exhausted` / a `force_restart`; `load_average["1m"]` against the host CPU count distinguishes CPU saturation from a diverging tactic when a timeout fires (`None` on platforms without `os.getloadavg`).  Field reports suggest this tool is consistently underused — worth a checklist line in your orchestrator prompt.

**Operator-side hardening:** the cleanest deployment is one `rocq-mcp` subprocess per concurrent agent.  Over stdio this happens naturally when each MCP client launches its own server; the case that needs care is parallel sub-agents within one client, which inherit the parent's MCP connections and share one `rocq-mcp`.  If you're orchestrating parallel Rocq work, prefer separate top-level invocations over one parent with concurrent sub-agents — or, within one client, the named-pool pattern below.

*Claude Code sub-agent scoping — and its limit.*  Sub-agents in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` accept an inline `mcpServers` entry in their frontmatter ([Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#scope-mcp-servers-to-a-subagent)).  An inline definition scopes a `rocq-mcp` server **to that sub-agent** — connected when the sub-agent starts, torn down when it finishes, and hidden from the main thread; a bare string reference shares the parent's connection instead.

**This scopes the server to the *definition*, not to each *instance*.**  Claude Code keys MCP servers **by name** — one server process per distinct name per session, shared by every sub-agent instance that references that name.  So `N` concurrently-running instances of the *same* sub-agent definition still share **one** `rocq-mcp` `pet`: the inline entry isolates a sub-agent's server from the *parent's*, not one instance from another.  (Name it something **unique**, too — an inline server literally named `rocq-mcp` collides with a session-level `rocq-mcp` server and is silently aliased to it.)

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - rocqprover:            # a UNIQUE name — not "rocq-mcp"
      type: stdio
      command: rocq-mcp
```

*Isolating concurrent instances — the named pool.*  Because the only isolation unit the harness exposes is the server **name**, give parallel work a **pool** of `N` sub-agent definitions, each with a **distinct** name — `rocq-prover-1.md` … `rocq-prover-N.md`, declaring servers `rocqprover1` … `rocqproverN`.  The harness then spawns `N` separate `rocq-mcp` processes, and the orchestrator hands **distinct pool members to concurrently-running slots** (round-robin the sub-agent type, capping concurrency at `N`).  The pool is additive — keep a plain `rocq-mcp` reference for sequential/shared runs — and size `N` to your parallelism budget (pets are RAM-heavy; pair with `ROCQ_MAX_PET_RSS_MB`).

```yaml
# .claude/agents/rocq-prover-1.md  (repeat for -2 … -N, bumping the number)
mcpServers:
  - rocqprover1:
      type: stdio
      command: rocq-mcp
      env:
        ROCQ_MAX_PET_RSS_MB: "8000"
```

Two caveats.  **Registration happens at startup** — Claude Code snapshots the agent registry when the session begins, so newly-added `rocq-prover-*.md` files are not selectable until you **restart** the client (`claude --continue` keeps the conversation).  And **plugin sub-agents ignore `mcpServers`** — sub-agents provided by a *plugin* silently drop the `mcpServers` / `hooks` / `permissionMode` frontmatter, so the pool must live in plain `.claude/agents/` files.

Server-side multi-tenancy is not an alternative here: over stdio the harness gives one server process a single connection carrying interleaved calls with no per-caller identity, so `rocq-mcp` cannot tell sub-agents apart from inside one process.  The name-keyed pool (or separate top-level `claude` invocations) is the only reliable isolation lever.

*Worktree per pool member.*  A pool member isolates its own `pet` subprocess; for filesystem isolation — so concurrent sub-agents can edit `.v` files without staling each other's interactive sessions (see *Stale file warning* above) — pair each member's `mcpServers` entry with a separate `git worktree`, and point `ROCQ_WORKSPACE` at it:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - rocqprover1:
      type: stdio
      command: rocq-mcp
      env:
        ROCQ_WORKSPACE: /path/to/worktree-1
```

Each worktree carries its own checkout, its own auto-generated `_RocqProject` (see *Prerequisites*), and its own scratch files — neither sub-agent can clobber the other's interactive sessions through a file edit, and `_RocqProject` regeneration in one worktree does not invalidate the other's load paths.

**Per-call timeout override.**  Pytanque-based tools (those routed through `_run_with_pet`: `rocq_query`, `rocq_start`, `rocq_step_multi`, `rocq_check`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_notations`) accept a `timeout=<seconds>` kwarg that overrides `ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT` for that one call (clamped to `ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP`).  On a timeout, prefer bumping `timeout=` per-call rather than raising the global default.

## Briefing sub-agents

When spawning a sub-agent that will write or check Rocq/Coq proofs,
prefix its task prompt with this preamble.  Without it, sub-agents
fall into a `Write` → `coqc /tmp/<file>.v` → `bash grep error` loop
that re-pays the import cost on every iteration; with it, they use
the held-pet primitives and keep heavy imports (e.g. `mathcomp`,
`stdpp`) warm across attempts.

````
Before any Write or `coqc` on a .v file:
  1. Consult any project-specific Rocq guidance first (e.g. a project
     CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or Skill if your environment has one).
  2. For scratch iteration on a single proof, use rocq-mcp:
       rocq_start file=/tmp/<name>.v theorem=<lemma>
       rocq_step_multi tactics=[...]   (NOT  coqc /tmp/<name>.v)
  3. Use `coqc` only for: full-project rebuilds, axiom audits via
     `Print Assumptions`, and final compile verification.
````

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ROCQ_WORKSPACE` | current directory | Working directory for Rocq compilation; used as the final fallback when no project marker is found by walking up from the file. When set explicitly, all workspace parameters are constrained to this directory or its subdirectories. |
| `ROCQ_COQC_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Timeout (seconds) for `rocq_compile` |
| `ROCQ_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Timeout (seconds) for `rocq_verify` |
| `ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Timeout (seconds) for pytanque-based tools |
| `ROCQ_QUERY_TIMEOUT_CAP` | `300` | Cap (seconds) on the per-call `timeout` parameter of any pytanque-based tool (`rocq_query`, `rocq_start`, `rocq_step_multi`, `rocq_check`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_notations`); larger values are clamped and the response carries `clamped_timeout: <cap>` |
| `ROCQ_ENRICHMENT_TIMEOUT_CAP` | `5.0` | Cap (seconds) on per-call proof-state capture after a `rocq_compile` / `rocq_compile_file` failure |
| `ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_CAP` | `20` | Maximum number of per-declaration errors collected in the `errors` field on a failed `rocq_compile_file`. Set to `0` to disable the feature. |
| `ROCQ_COMPILE_MULTI_ERROR_TIMEOUT` | `5.0` | Per-chunk timeout (seconds) for the multi-error walker used by `rocq_compile_file`. |
| `ROCQ_MAX_PET_RSS_MB` | `min(50% of system RAM, 16384)` | Maximum pet subprocess RSS (MB). On breach, the call aborts via the timeout recovery path; response includes `reason: "memory_exhausted"` and `pet_restarted: True`. |
| `ROCQ_MAX_STATES` | `1000` | Cap on the in-memory state table (LRU-evicted). The entry itself is tiny; the real cost lives in pet's Fleche cache and is bounded by `ROCQ_MAX_PET_RSS_MB`. Bump if two or more callers share this process (e.g. parallel sub-agents) and parked states get evicted before they're reused. |
| `ROCQ_COQC_BINARY` | `coqc` | Path to the `coqc` binary |
| `ROCQ_MAX_SOURCE_SIZE` | `1000000` | Maximum source size in bytes |
| `ROCQ_PET_TIMEOUT_GRACE` | `5.0` | Extra grace (seconds) added to the pet lock-acquisition wait beyond the per-call timeout, so a slow callee is distinguished from a genuinely stuck lock. |
| `ROCQ_DEBUG_ENRICHMENT` | unset | When set, degraded-enrichment notices are surfaced verbatim in responses instead of being logged best-effort; a debugging aid for the proof-state capture path. |

## Security Model

The verification tool (`rocq_verify`) uses defense in depth with three verification phases and multiple security layers.

### Verification phases

`rocq_verify` tries up to three phases in sequence, falling back to the next if the previous one times out:

1. **Phase 1 -- Module M sandbox.** The proof is wrapped inside `Module M. ... End M.`. The theorem is re-stated outside and proved via `exact M.<name>`. This is the strongest sandbox but can time out on compute-heavy proofs.

2. **Phase 2 -- Shared-defs template.** For problems with Inductive/Record/Definition types, type definitions are placed outside Module M to avoid nominal typing mismatches, while the proof stays inside the sandbox. Uses pytanque's `toc` to extract problem structure. Falls back from Phase 1 when type incompatibilities are detected.

3. **Phase 3 -- Direct verification.** When Phase 1 or Phase 2 times out or fails, the proof is compiled standalone (no Module M) with the full original timeout budget. Correctness is verified by comparing `Check <name>.` output against the problem statement's expected type after normalization. Additional security checks compensate for the lack of a sandbox (see below). This phase handles compute-heavy proofs that are too slow under Module M wrapping.

### Layer 1: Module M sandbox (Phases 1 & 2)

The Module M sandbox prevents:

- **Type redefinition cheating** -- Inductive/Record types are generative in Rocq, so redefining `nat` as `bool` inside Module M creates an incompatible type that cannot unify with the real `nat` outside.
- **Axiom spoofing** -- User-declared axioms receive an `M.` prefix in `Print Assumptions` output, which the stdlib whitelist rejects.
- **`Admitted`/`Abort` usage** -- Caught by `Print Assumptions`.
- **Module escape** -- `End M.` and `Reset`/`Back`/`Undo` are forbidden commands (see Layer 2).

### Layer 2: Forbidden command scanning

Source code is scanned for dangerous commands **after stripping comments**. The comment scanner matches Rocq's lexer exactly, including string literal tracking inside comments (preventing desynchronization attacks like `(* " (* " *) End M.`). Comments are replaced with spaces to preserve word boundaries.

Forbidden commands:

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Filesystem | `Redirect`, `Extraction "..."`, `Separate Extraction`, `Recursive Extraction`, `Extraction Library`, `Cd`, `Load` |
| Code loading | `Declare ML Module`, `Add LoadPath`, `Add Rec LoadPath`, `Add ML Path` |
| Sandbox escape | `End M.`, `Reset`, `Back`, `Undo` |
| Safety bypass | `bypass_check`, `Unset Guard Checking`, `Unset Positivity Checking`, `Unset Universe Checking` |
| Escape hatches | `Drop` (OCaml toplevel) |

### Layer 3: Print Assumptions axiom whitelist

After compilation, `Print Assumptions` is checked against a whitelist of standard library axioms (classical logic, functional extensionality, Reals axioms, primitive int/float/array/string operations, mathcomp.classical re-exports, etc.). Axioms with qualified names must have a recognized stdlib prefix (`Coq.*`, `Rocq.*`, `Stdlib.*`, `Corelib.*`, the full `mathcomp.classical.boolp.*` / `mathcomp.classical.classical_sets.*`, or known module prefixes like `ClassicalDedekindReals.*`). Bare module-name prefixes (e.g. a workspace-supplied `boolp.v`) are intentionally **not** trusted, so a user `Axiom EM : False.` cannot be auto-trusted just because it mimics mathcomp's short form. The `M.` prefix on user-declared axioms inside Phase 1 / 2 Module M sandboxing ensures they are always rejected.

Printing flags (`Set Printing All`, `Set Printing Universes`, `Set Printing Width`) are reset after `End M.` to prevent corruption of `Print Assumptions` output format.

### Phase 3 security checks

Without the Module M sandbox, Phase 3 applies additional checks to compensate:

- **Forbidden commands** -- Same scanning as Phases 1 & 2 (Layer 2).
- **Incomplete proof rejection** -- `Admitted`, `admit`, and `give_up` in the proof source are rejected outright.
- **Axiom-introducing commands blocked** -- `Axiom`, `Parameter`, and `Conjecture` declarations are rejected. (`Variable` and `Hypothesis` are allowed since they are section-local and become parameters after `End Section`, not global axioms.)
- **Print Assumptions check** -- Same axiom whitelist as Phases 1 & 2 (Layer 3). However, without the `M.` prefix from Module M, user-declared axioms could potentially spoof whitelisted names.
- **Type comparison** -- The proven type (via `Check @<name>.` with `Set Printing All`) is normalized and compared to the expected type from the problem statement. Universe annotations are stripped before comparison.

**Known limitations of Phase 3:**

- Without Module M, type redefinition attacks are not caught (e.g., redefining `nat` as `bool` then proving a trivially true statement).
- Notation/scope redefinition before identically-texted definitions can change kernel semantics without being detected by type comparison.
- Stdlib function shadowing (redefining functions called by the problem's definition) is not covered.

The `verification_method` field in the result indicates which phase was used (`"module_m"`, `"shared_defs"`, or `"direct"`).

### Trusted anchor

**Important:** The `problem_statement` parameter is treated as a **trusted anchor**. The server verifies that the proof proves the given statement, but does NOT verify that the statement itself is the correct problem. Callers must ensure `problem_statement` comes from a trusted source (e.g., a file on disk), not from the LLM being evaluated.

### Path validation

All tools that accept file paths validate that resolved paths stay within the configured workspace directory (preventing path traversal attacks).

### Project file security

When `_RocqProject` or `_CoqProject` is present, the server parses it for coqc load-path flags (`-Q`, `-R`, `-I`). For **dune projects** (no project file but a `dune-project` file exists), the server runs `dune coq top` once per `(coq.theory ...)` stanza in the workspace and unions the resulting flags into a generated `_RocqProject` so coq-lsp also picks them up. Querying every theory is required for multi-theory workspaces; querying just one would leave cross-theory imports broken. This generated file (marked with a `# Auto-generated by rocq-mcp from dune` header) stays in the workspace and should be added to `.gitignore`. Existing user-created project files are never overwritten. For safety:

- **`-arg` allowlist** -- Only known-safe flags are passed through (e.g., `-noinit`, `-w`, `-impredicative-set`). Dangerous flags like `-load-vernac-source` are silently dropped.
- **Path containment** -- For `_RocqProject`/`_CoqProject`, directories in `-Q`/`-R`/`-I` must resolve within the workspace. Absolute paths and `../` traversals outside the workspace are rejected. For dune-detected paths, containment is checked against the dune project root (the directory containing `dune-project`), since build artifacts typically live in `_build/` at the project root.

## Running

The server uses stdio transport:

```bash
rocq-mcp
```

### MCP client configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop, Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rocq-mcp": {
      "command": "rocq-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ROCQ_WORKSPACE": "/path/to/your/rocq/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Tests for pytanque-based tools (`rocq_query`, `rocq_assumptions`, `rocq_start`, `rocq_check`, `rocq_step_multi`, `rocq_toc`, `rocq_notations`) require `pet` to be installed. Integration tests will be skipped automatically if it is not available.
